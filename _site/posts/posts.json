Analytics can be of the following types, looking from the\r\npast to the future\r\nDescriptive analysis -  What happened \r\nDiagnostic analysis -  Why did it happen \r\nPredictive analysis -  What will happen \r\nPrescriptive analysis -  How can we make it happen\r\n\r\nIn this Lifecycle series, we will be following a particular use case\r\nrelated to healthcare. Now, more than ever before, healthcare domain is\r\nin the limelight. In the past few years, healthcare related decisions\r\nhave been the make or break factor for economies and countries around\r\nthe world. We have seen how different countries took different\r\napproaches and we also saw how there is no one size fits all. These are\r\nvaluable lessons that can be applied to all fields. The major lessons to\r\nbe learnt are:\r\nFor a decision for a seemingly isolated problem, you will soon\r\nrealize that there are multiple governing factors and there will be\r\nmultiple factors that are directly and indirectly impacted by this\r\ndecision.\r\nIt is important to understand not just the business problem but\r\nthe entire neighborhood of it. It is important to zoom out and ask\r\nquestions.For a Data Scientist, it is important to look beyond the data\r\nand understand the nook and corner of the related business.\r\nProblem Statement\r\nThe objective of a problem statement is to explain the current state,\r\nexplain the desired state and identify what is required to change the\r\ncurrent state to the desired state. Notice that the Problem Statement is\r\npurely, well, a problem statement and it does not include the solution\r\nor how we plan to achieve the desired from the current. The ‘how’ of it\r\nis still up for debate. It does however specify how we can measure the\r\nbenefit of the solution and at what stage we can say that we have\r\nachieved our objective.\r\nLet us formulate the problem statement for our healthcare\r\nscenario.\r\nThe Emergency Room (ER) of Hospital ABC sees hundreds of patients\r\neveryday. The ER has a process in place to triage every incoming\r\npatient. The ER Nurse will carry out some basic checks which includes\r\nmeasuring the blood pressure, temperature, oxygen level etc of the\r\npatient as well as ask a few questions about the age, pain level,\r\nexisting conditions,etc. All these are recorded and the Nurse will\r\nassign a Triage Acuity value ranging from 1-5, 1 being the highest.\r\nThe objective of this triage process is to enable the hospital system\r\nto priorities the patients so that those in need of immediate care are\r\nnot kept waiting. The patient then sees the doctor after which he may or\r\nmay not get hospitalized. Now, the hospital resources are limited -\r\nlimited number of beds, limited number of equipments, limited number of\r\nnurses. So we want to make sure that only those patients who are\r\ndefinitely in need of hospitalization are admitted. This is currently\r\ndone based on the experience of the doctor. Ah, there it is, a decision\r\nbased on gut feeling. While we have absolutely no doubt in the\r\ncapability of our doctors, we are looking at ways to improve patient\r\ncare while optimizing the utilization of hospital resources.\r\nWhat are our guiding factors at this point :\r\nProvide the best possible care to the patient\r\nAs fast as possible\r\nWithout inconveniencing the patient with unnecessary\r\ntests\r\nAvoid hospitalization if possible, this serves 2 purposes\r\nnot inconvenience the patient and reduce the cost to the\r\npatient\r\nsave the hospital resources for critical patients\r\n\r\nAvoid the patient from coming back to the ER immediately (time\r\nlimit to be defined)\r\nAvoid mortality\r\nThe dataset we are going to use for this case study has all details\r\nof patient visits to the ER, hospitalization details, discharge details.\r\nLet us focus on hospitalization for the purpose of this study.\r\nFor Machine Learning project, it is very critical to identify the\r\ndata that is available at the point of time when our model is going to\r\nbe utilized. \r\nFor example, our model is to predict if a patient who has come into\r\nthe ER will get hospitalized or not, what is the data that is\r\navailable?\r\nWe have the details recorded by the Triage nurse\r\nWe have the details of the patients previous visits\r\nWhat we do not have are the following:\r\nany details of what happens after the triage nurse has collected the\r\ndata\r\nLet us now define our Outcome column. For our case study we want to\r\nidentify the records in the data set where the patient who came to the\r\nER has been hospitalized. From the data dictionary, we know that the\r\npatients who are hospitalized are assigned a hospital admission id\r\n(hdm_id) for that particular stay. We will use this column to derive our\r\nOutcome_Hospitalization column with the following code\r\n\r\nLet us now analyse what percentage of ER patients get hospitalized\r\nusing the below code.\r\n\r\nThe hospitalization rate is 46% approx. When a patient comes to ER,\r\nby assessing the chances of the patient getting hospitalized, the\r\nmedical team can further optimize the treatment plan with the objective\r\nof avoiding hospitalization. We do understand that hospitalization\r\ncannot be always avoided even with optimized treatment. Hence, we can\r\ndecide on reducing the hospitalization rate to a 35% over a period of\r\nnext 3 months as our objective. In real life scenario, this decision\r\nwill be taken based on discussions with the stakeholders.\r\nIt is also important to define a control. In this case, in our effort\r\nto reduce hospitalization rate, we should not end up compromising on the\r\ncare. So mortality and ER Readmission will be our control.\r\nLet us now frame our Problem Statement:\r\n The current rate of Hospitalization from\r\nthe ER is 46%. This results in a large proportion of the hospital\r\nfacility being occupied, sometimes resulting in unavailability. The\r\nbusiness objective is to reduce hospitalization by providing optimum\r\ncare in the ER. The success criteria to judge whether the problem has\r\nbeen solved is, in the next 3 months, the hospitalization rate should\r\ncome down to 35% without increase in mortality rate and ER Readmission\r\nrate. \r\nWe now have the business problem, which needs to be mapped to a\r\ndata science problem.\r\n The hospital has records of\r\nhospitalizations over a period of time. Using this data, we can train a\r\nclassification model which can predict the chances that a new patient\r\nwho has come to the ER will get hospitalized. This can give insight to\r\nthe medical team regarding the hospitalization chances if the existing\r\ntreatment protocol is followed. Based on this, the team can optimize the\r\ntreatment protocol for the patient in the ER resulting in reduced\r\nhospitalization. \r\nNow we have established a direction for our data science project. We\r\nwill traverse through the rest of the project lifecycle in parts\r\nExploratory Data Analysis\r\nData Wrangling\r\nModel Training and Evaluation\r\nHyperparameter Tuning\r\nDashboard Development\r\nStay tuned for Exploratory Data Analysis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
